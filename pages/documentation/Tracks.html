			<h2 id="full">Full Stack Web Developer</h2>
			<article>
				<img src="s.jpg">
				<p>
					The web is a very big place, and if you are the typical internet user, you probably visit several
					websites every day, whether for business, entertainment or education. But have you ever wondered how
					these websites actually work? How are they built? How do browsers, computers, and mobile devices
					interact with the web? What skills are necessary to build a website?
				</p>

				<p>
					As the Web has grown more complex and as more becomes possible on the Internet, developers have
					gotten more specialized. That means that web development now means a lot of different things
					depending on what a web developer specializes in. Here are the three main categories:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>front end development (the visible parts of a website or app)</li>
					<li>back end development (the “under the hood” databases and infrastructure)</li>
					<li>full stack development (a hybrid of both). Full stack can apply to
						<ul>
							<li>web stack</li>
							<li>mobile stack</li>
							<li>native application stack</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To understand what each of the web developer specialties (or in the case of full stack web
					developers, non-specialties) are, we’ve created a guide breaking them all down, along with the
					skills you need to learn to become a full stack developer—if that’s your thing.

			<article>
				<img src="s.jpg">
				<p>
					System Administrator, is responsible for the upkeep, configuration, and reliable operation of client
					computer systems, servers, and data security systems.

					The administrator ensures that internal IT structure of the enterprise remains up-to-date.

					Administrators avert possible cyber-attacks for greater productivity as per company policies and
					procedures.

					In most organizations, Administrators manage all servers, network equipment, and other related IT
					infrastructure. Companies consider these professionals the backbone of a Telecom or IT organization.
				</p>

				<p>
					They play a vital role in
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Manage electronic equipment</li>
					<li>Install network and computer system</li>
					<li>Maintain, repair and upgrade the operating system including hardware and software</li>
					<li>Monitor the performance of existing computer systems and IT infrastructures</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					To become an IT Administrator, it is essential that one should have strong inter, organizational and
					problem resolving expertise. As an administrator one should be acquainted with all feature of
					project management, such as costing and scheduling, along with strong time management skills.
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>assess present network serves, operating systems and security layer</li>
					<li>upgrade hardware and software programs</li>
					<li>install and implement effective security systems</li>
					<li>perform data backup and recovery processes</li>
					<li>resolve issues with systems and programs</li>

			<article>
				<img src="s.jpg"></img>
				<p>Embedded systems are the systems of future with cellular phones, smart-phones, tablets becoming the
					dominant platforms for computing and communication.</p>

				<p>
					The ubiquity of information and the associated need for the computation that accompanies it is
					driving this revolution only to be accelerated by the new paradigms such as the Internet-of-Things
					(IoT).
				</p>

				<p>
					These platforms are clearly very different in terms of their processing requirements which are very
					unique:
				</p>

				<ul>
					<li>real-time needs</li>
					<li>high performance but at low energy</li>
					<li>compact-code and data segments</li>
					<li>changing software stack</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					Such unique requirements have led to a complete redesign and reinvention of the both hardware and
					the software stack from ground up, for example,
				<ol>
					<li>brand new processors (Dalvik) were invented all the way up to new virtual machines
						<ul>
							<li>ARM</li>
							<li>DSPs</li>
							<li>network processors</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>new operating systems
						<ul>
							<li>Android</li>
						</ul>
					</li>

					<li>new programming models</li>
					<li>compiler optimizations</li>
				</ol>

				<img src="s.jpg">
				<p>
					graphic design is defined as “the art and practice of planning and projecting ideas and experiences
					with visual and textual content that communicates certain ideas or messages in a visual way. These
					visuals can be as simple as;
				<ol>
					<li>defining requirements</li>
					<li>visualizing and creating graphics
						<ul>
							<li>illustrations</li>
							<li>logos</li>
							<li>layouts</li>
							<li>photos</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>
					To better understand the meaning of graphic design, it is important to be aware of the elements and
					principles that make up design used in conjunction or opposition with each other to create visually
					striking and impactful designs.
				<ul style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; justify-content: space-around;">
					<li>Color</li>
					<li>Form</li>
					<li>Shape</li>
					<li>Size</li>
					<li>Texture</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Graphic design is composed of many fields and specializations, ranging from print and web design to
					animation and motion graphics.
				<ul>
					<li>Website design, creates web pages includes overall layout & navigation.</li>
					<li>User experience (UX) focuses on ensuring a website or application is easy to use through
						emphasizing value, usability</li>
					<li>Motion graphics design that brings visual elements to life through special effects, TV shows,
						video games and movies.</li>
